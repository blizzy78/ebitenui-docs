Ebiten UI
=========

**A user interface engine and widget library for [Ebitengine]**

Ebiten UI is an extension to Ebiten that provides an engine to render a complete user interface,
with widgets such as buttons, lists, combo boxes, and so on. It uses the [retained mode] model.
All graphics used by Ebiten UI can be fully customized, so you can really make your UI your own.

*Ebiten UI is currently under development and should not yet be used in production.*
